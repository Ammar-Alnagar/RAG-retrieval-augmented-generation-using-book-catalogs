# RAG Retrieval-Augmented Generation Using Book Catalogs

Welcome to the RAG Retrieval-Augmented Generation Using Book Catalogs repository! 📚✨ This project integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with book catalogs to enhance the capabilities of language models in generating and retrieving relevant information based on extensive book data.

## 📜 Overview

The RAG Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework combines the power of retrieval-based and generative models to provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses. This project applies the RAG model to book catalogs, enabling advanced querying and content generation based on extensive literary data.

## 🚀 Features

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation:** Leverage RAG to combine retrieval and generation for enhanced information accuracy.
- **Book Catalog Integration:** Utilize comprehensive book catalogs to provide contextually rich responses and generate detailed content.
- **Customizable Pipelines:** Easily adapt the retrieval and generation pipelines to suit specific needs or datasets.
- **Pretrained Models:** Access pretrained RAG models and book catalogs to jumpstart your experiments.
- **Interactive Querying:** Perform advanced querying and content generation based on book data.

## 📥 Installation

To get started with RAG Retrieval-Augmented Generation Using Book Catalogs, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RAG-retrieval-augmented-generation-using-book-catalogs.git
   cd RAG-retrieval-augmented-generation-using-book-catalogs
   ```

2. **Set Up Your Environment:**
   Ensure you have Python 3.8 or later installed. Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies:
   ```bash
